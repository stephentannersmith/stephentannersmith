### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tanner Smith and I am a Musician turned Jr. Developer seeking my first professional job as a programmer. While my first full stack project was build with Python and Flask, my new primary focus is on building with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. My goal over the next few years is to become one of the best MERN developers in the state of Oklahoma and to dip my toes into the pool of machine learning. I'm looking forward to exceeding expectations and helping to build some of the coolest platforms of the 21st century.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own SUPER COOL music networking application.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any music-related applications.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything :)
