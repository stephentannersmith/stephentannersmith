### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Up until this point, my career experience was very much like a mullet: business in the front and party in the back. With the introduction of computer programming to the mix, it's finally starting to shape into a professionally-manicured hairstyle.

As a classically-trained musician turned machine learning enthusiast, my career has been a wild ride thus far. Within six years after my college graduation, I've worked and volunteered in four cities and held a variety of positions. The beginning of my career was primarily focused on music composition and sound design in Toronto. After my one-year visa expired, I moved to Buffalo NY where I was exposed to the hustle and bustle of a startup business renaissance. I quickly snagged my first job as a sales representative for what went on to become one of Buffalo's first unicorns: ACV Auctions (now valued at $1.5B). It was here I fell in love with the agility of startups and the overall open-door atmosphere where ideas could be spun up and implemented within months if there was enough enthusiasm.

Fast forward to my last year in Buffalo, I joined the Founders Institute, a 16 week program dedicated to giving new business owners the resources necessary to run a successful startup. I graduated from FI with a strong pitch deck and a fully incorporated company, BandsToWatch Inc.

In Summer of 2019, I moved back to Oklahoma City to surround myself with a strong support system of my friends and family while I built my business (plus I really missed my dog.) I thrust myself into the local startup community and found myself working with Deep Fork Technologies, a local dev team, who helped me find a proper pivot for BandsToWatch and led me to enroll in Coding Dojo, an intense bootcamp for web developers.

After attending a few networking events, I found Chivvy who hired me as Director of Client Relations where I quickly found the flaws in the original product and was promoted to spearhead the development of the missing piece.

After graduating Coding Dojo with a Black Belt (the highest rank), my primary focus is on building full stack applications using both the Python and MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stacks. My goal over the next few years is to become one of the best MERN developers in the state of Oklahoma and to dip my toes into the pool of machine learning. I'm looking forward to exceeding expectations and helping to build some of the coolest platforms of the 21st century.

What are you waiting for? Let's build something together!
